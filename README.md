# Intelligent-agents

Learning multiple artificial intelligence methods via a common problem : The pickup and delevery problem. An agent needs to pickup a task in a city and deliver it to another city. The reward should be optimized. For every part, a theorical background is given. 

## Oriented-object Java introduction

Ecosystem simulation consisting of a population of agents (rabbits) making use of the environnement (grass).

## Markov Decision process

An agent with an infinite number of tasks. The value function is calculated in order to optimize the expected future reward. 

## Breadth-first search and A* algorithm

An agent with a finite number of tasks. The agent should calculate the shortest path to get all the tasks done so the reward will be maximal. 

## Distributed constraint optimization problem

Multiple agents with a finite number of tasks. The goal is to make a plan where the sum of the distance covered by all the agents is minimized. 

## Auctions and game-theory

We run a company with multiple vehicles (agents) and we compete against other companies. A task is selled using a sealed-bid auction to the company requesting the less amount of money for the task. We should try to find the best strategy to ensure the maximum expected reward for the company against the other companies.
